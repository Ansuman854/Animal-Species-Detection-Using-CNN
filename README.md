# Animal-Species-Detection-Using-CNN
Built an image classification system to identify 10 animal species (e.g., cat, dog, elephant) using CNN architectures:
ZFNet, VGG16, and GoogLeNet. Trained models on a 28,000-image dataset and evaluated performance on accuracy
and speed. ZFNet showed highest accuracy (69.4%) and lowest inference time.
